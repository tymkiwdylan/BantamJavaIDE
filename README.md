# BantamJavaIDE

This was a semester long project that I worked on along two classmates: Cassidy, and Jasper. The project consisted on developing an IDE for Bantam Java. We also implemented a bunch of really cool features!!

## Features:

### Transpiler: 
  Our IDE has a transpiler that takes in Bantam Java code and converts it into Java code so that you can compile and run it.
  
### Dark Mode (We all know what this is)

### Pretty Printer:
  It grabs your ugly ðŸ¤® code and turns it into readable code.

## Want to try our compiler?

You can clone the repository and run it with Intellij!!
